# E.diaphana_genotyping_analysis

DNA from a random sample of anemones held in the newly-established _E.diaphana_ culture collection at the University of Melbourne was supplied to Diversity Array Technologies (Canberra, Australia) for SNP analysis to determine how many distinct genotypes existed within the collection.

There are two R scripts in this repo. One script generates the PCoA used in the publication __Dungan AM, Hartman LM, Tortorelli G, Belderock R, Lamb AM, Pisan L et al. Exaiptasia diaphana from the Great Barrier Reef: a valuable resource for coral symbiosis research. _Symbiosis_. 2020; doi:10.1007/s13199-020-00665-0__. A second script identifies SNPs that could be used in a PCR-based assay to distinguish each genotype.
