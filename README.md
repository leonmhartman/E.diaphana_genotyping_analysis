# E.diaphana_genotyping_analysis

After establishing an _E.diaphana_ culture collection at the University of Melbourne, DNA from a random sample of anemones were supplied to Diversity Array Technologies (Canberra, Australia) for SNP analysis to determine how many distinct genotypes existed within the collection.

There are two R scripts in this repo. One is an analysis of the SNP data. A second filters the data to identify SNPs that could be used in a PCR-based assay to identify each genotype.
