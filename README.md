# E.diaphana_genotyping_analysis

After establishing _E.diaphana_ culture collection at the University of Melbourne, an assortment of DNA samples were supplied to Diversity Array Technologies (Canberra, Australia) for SNP analysis to determine how many distinct genotypes existed within the collection.

There are two R scripts in this repo. One is an analysis of the SNP data. A second filters the data to identify SNPs that could be used in a PCR-based assay to identify each genotype.
